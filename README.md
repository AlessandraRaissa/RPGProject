# rpg_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I'm creating an app for those who wish to make digital characters sheets for a game. 

Here I'm trring to make it seems easy for the player AND the master, as they both can use the app 
and define the game system and the rules the players need to follow when creating their sheets.

The process will be automatic for some things like, bonuses points, proeficience points, classes, 
spells, itens, levels and etc depending on how the game system whas defined and how the player is making his character sheet.

Gonna put more details from the project as the development progresses
